	<h1>About degh ogy</h1>
	<p>"Nobody's perfect I'll never try,
	But I promise I'm worth it if you just open up your eyes,
	I don't need a second chance,
	I need a friend,
	Someone who's gon' stand by me right there till the end,
	If you want the best of my heart, you've just gotta see the good in me,
	'Cause I could be the rain in your desert sky,
	I could be the fire in your darkest night,
	I could be your curse or your angel,
	It's all in how you love me" - Rodeo Clown</p>
